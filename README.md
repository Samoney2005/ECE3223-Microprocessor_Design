# ECE3223-Microprocessor_Design

## Overview
This repository contains assignments, labs, and projects for **ECE 3223 Microprocessor System Design** at the University of Oklahoma.  
The course focuses on microprocessor architecture, sequential circuits, MSI/LSI devices, and system integration using assembly and C++ (mbed/Keil).[web:1][cite:19]

## Key Concepts
- Clocked sequential circuits and state machines
- MSI/LSI components (registers, buses, combinational logic)
- Microprocessor interfacing and assembly programming
- Embedded C++ with mbed/Keil (BusOut, display routines)
- Digital system simulations (e.g., Logisim/VHDL)

## What You'll Work On
- **Labs**: 7-segment display drivers (segConvert 0-9, decimal, negative), timing loops with wait_us(500000)
- **Projects**: Full microprocessor systems (peripheral integration, signal integrity)
- **Code Examples**: Cleaned mbed C++ pushed from Keil Studio Cloud to GitHub
